{{female-name}} was a {{job title}} who loved technology. Although she loved parts of her job, she absolutely hated  {{tedious-task}} and {{dirty task}}. So, {{female-name}} met with her life mentor {{celebrity}} who told her to learn how to {{useless-skill}} with Thinkful. Thinkful didn't offer a course on {{useless-skill}} so she studied programming instead.

What a great decision! With her new skills, {{female-name}} built a(n) {{adjective}} robot named {{obnoxiuous-celebrity}} that not only loved {{dirty-task}} but did it {{huge-number}} times faster.
